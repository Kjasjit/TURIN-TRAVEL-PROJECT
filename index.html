    <h2>Why Turin?</h2>
    <h3>Turin, the city of business and cultural centre in Northern Italy.</h3>
    <p>
        Turin was the first capital of modern Italy, 
        and was the host of the 2006 Winter Olympic 
        Games. While it's not a famous tourist 
        destination like Florence or Rome, the setting 
        is pleasant, with the Po River flowing through 
        the city, the genteel hills overlooking the city 
        and scattered with pleasant villas and surrounded 
        by the Italian Alps off in the distance. This is
         why the famous architect Le Corbusier defined 
         Turin as "the city with the most beautiful natural 
         location in the world".

    </p>
    <p>
    Turin is an important city of technology and industry, 
    and the FIAT automobile company is based here. 
    (The 'T' in the name stands for Torino; FIAT = 
    Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino, which translates as: Italian Automobile Factory Turin.)
     It was also the birthplace to many important cultural and political movements in Italy.

    Turin inhabitants are well known across Italy for their understatement and composure and the city reflects this attitude.
